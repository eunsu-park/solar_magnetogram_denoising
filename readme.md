# Solar Magnetogram Denoising (Keras, TensorFlow2)

Park et al., 2019, ApJL, submitted

Title: Denoising SDO/HMI Solar Magnetogram by Deep Learning based on Generative Adversarial Network

## Network Architectures

The architectures are based on https://github.com/eunsu-park/solar_euv_generation (Park+ 2019, ApJL)

## To run this code,

Keras: Change some parameters in option.py (about your environments) and run train.py
TensorFlow2: Change some parameters in denoising_tf2.ipynb and run the notebook
